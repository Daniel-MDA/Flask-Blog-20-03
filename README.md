## Creating an account at Github

To start with, you need an account at github. Following this [link](https://github.com/join) you will be able to set an account.

## Creating a project (Github)

Just follow this: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world . Its important that you complete this tutorial. You'll be able to learn more about Git(hub) and also create your first project. **Pay attention** in terms like *'commit', 'merge', 'branch', 'pull request'*. These are fundamental terms to know Git. Then, go back to the last link and do that tutorial.

## Cloning a project (Git)

You are now using Git to change, via terminal, a project. Please, install Git on your local (or virtual) machine: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git . 

* Getting a Git Repository:

You may be wondering how about creating a Git repository. You can do this in command line. For now, you are going to use an existing one. Following this https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository you can see how to create/cloning a repository. You're going to clone this repository. Remember about you credentials. You will need it. So, **clone me!**

## Docker

- Go to the repo's directory and open it with your preferred IDE (or Editor).

You are done! Now, you can see the update in the README file. If you created a new banch (recommended as best practice) and then push it, you are doing a pull request to merge the new branch to the master one, and someone have to approve your request to merge your contributions to the code.

That's it. You learned the basics about Git. :rocket:  :rocket:
